                            <h5>Overview</h5>
                            <p>One of the reasons why employees experience difficulties or worse, can’t sell their products is not because their products are a hard sell. The truth is, a lot of people, if not everyone, may/might desire them. The product may/might really become a necessity more than a luxury.</br></br>The true root cause is that they fail to grab their prospect’s attention and make that instant connection much less address their prospect’s hesitations, challenges, or worries about availing of one.</br></br> Selling is communicating. Communicating is speaking. Speaking involves talking. Talking makes use of words. Therefore, if employees would just have impeccable sway of how to think, what to say, how to sound, and how to look coupled with a masterful effort to put themselves in their prospect’s shoes and help them overcome their hesitations, challenges, or worries that get in the way of application, then pushing for their products or services would be less difficult or challenging.</br></br><b>This one-day learning experience will equip you with the best competencies and practices to help your customers assess your offerings as a value-adding necessity. </b></p>
